# DirectCall
This is a simple add-on for the Locus Map app which allows you to add a button to the main map screen for calling a configured phone number with a single touch.

How to use:
* Install this add-on from the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.niklas_guertler.directcall) or via the [APK file](https://github.com/Erlkoenig90/DirectCall/releases/download/v0.1_2/app-release.apk).
* From your apps screen/launcher, start "DirectCall Settings" and configure the desired phone number and additional settings.
* Re-Start Locus Map, tap the "set function panels" button, tap the "+" and then "Add function button". Select "DirectCall" from the category "Add-ons".
* Tap the newly added DirectCall button to start a test call. You may need to confirm the "phone" permission the first time you do this.

Features:
* Call a preconfigured phone number from the Locus Map main screen
* Optionally display a confirmation dialog before calling
* Optionally call with speaker enabled
* Starting "DirectCall" from your apps screen/launcher will also start a call, same way as the button in Locus Map
* DirectCall does not perform a VoIP call, but uses the default phone app on your device to start a regular phone call
